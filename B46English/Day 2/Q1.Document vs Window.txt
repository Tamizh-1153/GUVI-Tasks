In web development, the document and window objects are two important objects that are frequently used. They are both global objects that are 
available in the browser environment, but they serve different purposes. In this blog post, we will discuss the main differences between the document 
and window objects.

The window Object

The window object represents the current browser window or tab. It is the top-level object in the browser's object model hierarchy, and it provides 
access to various properties and methods that can be used to interact with the browser window. Some of the common properties and methods of the 
window object include:

window.location: Returns the current URL of the page.
window.open(): Opens a new browser window or tab.
window.close(): Closes the current browser window.
window.setTimeout(): Executes a function after a specified time delay.

The document Object

The document object represents the HTML document that is currently loaded in the browser window. It provides access to the DOM (Document Object 
Model) of the page, which is a hierarchical representation of the HTML elements on the page. Some of the common properties and methods of the 
document object include:

document.getElementById(): Returns a reference to the HTML element with the specified ID.
document.createElement(): Creates a new HTML element.
document.querySelector(): Returns the first element that matches the specified CSS selector.
document.title: Returns the title of the document.

Key Differences

=> The window object represents the entire browser window, while the document object represents the current HTML document loaded in the window.

=> The window object provides methods for controlling the browser window, such as opening and closing windows, while the document object provides 
      methods for creating and manipulating HTML elements.
