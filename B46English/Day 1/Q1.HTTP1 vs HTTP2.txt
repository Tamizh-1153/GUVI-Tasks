HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for the transfer of data over the web. It is the foundation of communication between clients 
(such as browsers) and servers (such as web servers). The protocol has undergone several updates over the years, with HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 being the 
most widely used versions. In this blog post, we will explore the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

HTTP/1.1:

HTTP/1.1 is the most widely used version of HTTP. It was first introduced in 1999 and has been in use ever since. It uses a request-response model 
where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with the requested data.

One of the major drawbacks of HTTP/1.1 is that it is a serial protocol, which means that only one request can be sent at a time. 
This can result in slow performance, particularly when loading web pages with lots of resources (such as images, scripts, and stylesheets). 
In order to work around this, HTTP/1.1 introduces the concept of pipelining, where multiple requests can be sent at the same time. However,
pipelining can lead to head-of-line blocking, where one slow request can block other requests from being processed.

Another limitation of HTTP/1.1 is that it does not compress headers, which can add unnecessary overhead to the request and response messages.

HTTP/2:

HTTP/2 was introduced in 2015 as an updated version of HTTP/1.1. It was designed to address the limitations of HTTP/1.1 and to provide better 
performance and efficiency. One of the major changes in HTTP/2 is that it uses a binary protocol instead of the text-based protocol used in HTTP/1.1. 
This means that the data is sent in a compressed binary format, which reduces the size of the request and response messages.

Another key feature of HTTP/2 is multiplexing, which allows multiple requests to be sent at the same time over a single connection. This eliminates 
the need for pipelining and reduces the impact of head-of-line blocking.

HTTP/2 also introduces server push, which allows the server to send additional resources to the client without the client having to request them. 
This can improve the performance of web pages by reducing the number of round trips required to load all the necessary resources.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, HTTP/2 is a significant improvement over HTTP/1.1 in terms of performance and efficiency. Its binary protocol, multiplexing, and 
server push features allow for faster and more efficient communication between clients and servers. While HTTP/1.1 is still widely used, it is 
likely to be phased out in favor of HTTP/2 in the coming years as more websites and web servers adopt the newer protocol.
